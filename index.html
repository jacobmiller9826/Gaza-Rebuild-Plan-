      <h2>Building Hope From What’s Left</h2>
      <p>
        This project started as a personal story — living in Tucson, Arizona without credit, I bought a vintage <strong>1999 Aljo Ally trailer</strong> and rebuilt it using reclaimed wood, metal, and furniture pulled from local yards, alleys, and construction scraps. 
        I rented a lot in a small trailer park for <strong>$500 a month</strong> — that was my foundation. From there, I learned how broken things can be reborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, that same concept is the seed for a larger idea: helping rebuild Gaza — or any community destroyed by conflict or poverty — using what’s available. 
        Not through big corporations or government loans, but through <em>resourceful, decentralized rebuilding</em>. This repository is the first draft of that idea.
