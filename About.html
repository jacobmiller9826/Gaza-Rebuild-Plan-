      <h2>From Tucson to Gaza — A Shared Struggle</h2>
      <p>
        When you can’t get credit, can’t buy a house, and can’t rely on the system — you learn to survive differently. 
        Buying a 1999 trailer and rebuilding it with reclaimed materials wasn’t just about saving money — it was a statement about 
        <strong>self-reliance, creativity, and dignity</strong>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Gaza Rebuild Plan takes that mindset global. 
        Imagine teaching families to rebuild homes using recycled concrete, melted-down metals, and solar-powered tools made from scrap electronics. 
        Imagine turning rubble into raw material — transforming broken neighborhoods into living, breathing art installations of resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository doesn’t claim to have the full plan — it’s a <strong>starting point</strong>.  
        It’s open-source so builders, designers, engineers, and everyday people can share, adapt, and grow these concepts.
