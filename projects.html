      <h2>Current Ideas Under Development</h2>
      <ul class="project-list">
        <li>
          <h3>1. Trailer Rebuild & Mobility</h3>
          <p>
            My Tucson trailer taught me that a stable home doesn’t have to be built from scratch — it can be <em>reclaimed</em>. 
            Using modular trailer designs, reclaimed wood, solar panels, and local metalwork, 
            we could create affordable, mobile housing units for displaced families worldwide.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>2. Recycled Material Marketplaces</h3>
          <p>
            A decentralized platform (blockchain-backed) for buying, trading, and tracking reclaimed building materials. 
            It ensures transparency, fair pricing, and eco-conscious construction while empowering local artisans.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>3. Gaza Green Zones</h3>
          <p>
            Converting bombed-out lots into small-scale urban gardens and solar farms. 
            Community-led reforestation projects, using irrigation systems powered by salvaged car batteries and water pumps.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4. The Education Network</h3>
          <p>
            Open workshops and digital tutorials teaching anyone — from Tucson to Gaza — how to rebuild with their hands, 
            not just rely on outside help. Every project becomes both a home and a classroom.
